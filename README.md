# Crypto For Daddio

## Ben's Pro Trader Tips

- Use Coinbase and Coinbase Pro for buying crypto with fiat
- Learn about support and resistance.
- Learn about risk management.
  - It doesn't need to be crypto specific any trading info on those subject will do.
- candlestick patterns and technical indicators do work for crypto but they're best used as confirmation for res/sup strategies. Used alone they ain't so hot

## Ben's Path to Greatness

1. Learn about support and resistance.
2. Learn about risk management.
3. Research everything you invest in thoroughly. 
4. Use these newly acquired skills to make some mid to long term investments.
5. If you can't tell a person what a crypto asset does in 5 minutes, you need to research it more and shouldn't be investing in it.
6. Make pretend trades on paper to practice your new strategies. DO NOT swing trade until you've watched a market long enough to win your practice trades more than you lose them. 
7. Start trading
8. Profit (hopefully)
